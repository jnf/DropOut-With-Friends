    <h1>DropOut-With-Friends</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Of the combination effects available in Scriptaculous,
      <a href="http://wiki.github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/effect-dropout" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">
      Effect.DropOut</a> is one of my favorites. I very much like how it's just
      wrapping two simple effects &#45; Move and Opacity &#45; with Effect.Parallel and giving it a clever name.
      I also like how the name tells me what's happening. It's dropping out. It's leaving town.
      It's joining the army, or maybe starting a band. Either way, it's not here anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effect.DropOut deserved a twin. BlindUp has BlindDown. Appear has Fade. SlideDown has SlideUp. I thought about it
      over lunch today and couldn't decide if the twin to DropOut would be DropIn or PullOut. You see, the name DropOut
      conveys two unique attributes of the action. First, the effected element is dropping; it's y&#45;value is increasing.
      Second, it's becoming invisible; it's opacity is decreasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking in those terms, it became obvious that Effect.DropOut wasn't born a twin, but rather a quadruplet. The full family
      is DropOut, DropIn, PullIn and PullOut. That covers all the possible combinations of direction and result. Neat, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and I thought it was silly that DropOut was fixed to 100 pixels of vertical movement, so I just made that a default that
      can be changed with the <em>distance</em> parameter in the options hash. So now you can control direction, distance and result.

        <p>April is the cruellest month, breeding</p>
        <p>Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing</p>
        <p>Memory and desire, stirring</p>
        <p>Dull roots with spring rain.</p>
        <p>Winter kept us warm, covering</p>
        <p>Earth in forgetful snow, feeding</p>
        <p>A little life with dried tubers.</p>
        <p>Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee</p>
        <p>With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,</p>
        <p>And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,</p>
        <p>And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.</p>
        <p>Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.</p>
        <p>And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,</p>
        <p>My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,</p>
        <p>And I was frightened. He said, Marie,</p>
        <p>Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.</p>
        <p>In the mountains, there you feel free.</p>
        <p>I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.</p>
        <p>What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow</p>
        <p>Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,</p>
        <p>You cannot say, or guess, for you know only</p>
        <p>A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,</p>
        <p>And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,</p>
        <p>And the dry stone no sound of water. Only</p>
        <p>There is shadow under this red rock,</p>
        <p>(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),</p>
        <p>And I will show you something different from either</p>
        <p>Your shadow at morning striding behind you</p>
        <p>Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;</p>
        <p>I will show you fear in a handful of dust.</p>
